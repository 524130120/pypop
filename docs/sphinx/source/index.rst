.. This is the official documents of PyPop7 (Pure-PYthon library of POPulation-based black-box OPtimization).

Welcome to PyPop7's Documentation!
==================================

**PyPop7** is a *Pure-PYthon* library of *POPulation-based OPtimization* for single-objective, real-parameter, black-box problems. Its main goal is to provide a *unified* interface and *elegant* implementations for **Black-Box Optimizers (BBO)**, *particularly population-based optimizers*, in order to facilitate research repeatability and also real-world applications.

More specifically, for alleviating the notorious **curse of dimensionality** of BBO (almost based on *iterative sampling*), the primary focus of PyPop7 is to cover their **State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) implementations for Large-Scale Optimization (LSO)**, though many of their other versions and variants are also included here (for benchmarking/mixing purpose, and sometimes even for practical purpose).
