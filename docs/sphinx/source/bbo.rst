Black-Box Optimization (BBO)
============================

.. note:: *”Certainly, and especially because of the broad availability of difficult and important applications, this
   promises to be an exciting, interesting, and challenging area for many years to come.“* ---[Conn et al., 2009:
   INTRODUCTION TO DERIVATIVE-FREE OPTIMIZATION]

No Free Lunch Theorems (NFL)
----------------------------

As mathematically proved in `[Wolpert&Macready, 1997, TEVC] <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/585893>`_, **"for any
algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class."**

General-Purpose Optimization Algorithms

.. note:: *"Given the abundance of black-box optimization algorithms and of optimization problems, how can best match
   algorithms to problems."* ---`[Wolpert&Macready, 1997, TEVC] <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/585893>`_
