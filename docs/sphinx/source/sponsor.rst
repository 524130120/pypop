(CSE, SUSTech @ Shenzhen, China), and actively developed by three of his group members (e.g., *Qiqi Duan*, *Chang Shao*,
and *Guochen Zhou*).

  * Now *Zhuowei Wang* from University of Technology Sydney (UTS) takes part in this library as one core developer (for
    testing).
  * Now *Mingyang Feng* from University of Birmingham (UoB) helps to search papers involved in this library.
  * Now *Yijun Yang* from University of Technology Sydney (UTS) helps to suggest Bayesian optimization (BO).
  * Now *Qi Zhao* from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) helps to proofread all the documents.
