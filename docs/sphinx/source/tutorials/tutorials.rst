The above figure shows the evolution of lens shape,
optimized by `MAES <https://pypop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/es/maes.html>`_.

The objective of Lens Shape Optimization is to find the optimal shape of glass body such that parallel incident light
rays are concentrated in a given point on a plane while using a minimum of glass material possible.
Refer to `Beyer, 2020, GECCO <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3377929.3389870>`_ for more details.
