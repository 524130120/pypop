# pypop

```PyPop``` is a *Pure-PYthon* library of **POPulation-based OPtimization** for real-parameter, black-box problems (**currently actively developed**). Its goal is to provide a *unified* interface and also *elegant* implementations for **Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO)**, *particularly population-based optimizers*, in order to facilitate research repeatability and real-world applications.

## Research Support

This open-source Python library for black-box optimization is now supported by **Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program** under Grant No. JCYJ20200109141235597 (ï¿¥2,000,000), granted to **Prof. Yuhui Shi** (CSE, SUSTech @ Shenzhen, China), and actively developed (from 2021 to 2023) by his group members (e.g., **Qiqi Duan**, *Chang Shao*, Youkui Zhang).
